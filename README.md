What is The SkillPedia?
The SkillPedia is an online marketplace, a community where anybody with a skill can teach and anyone can learn.

At The SkillPedia, we take learning and teaching to another level. We do this by connecting anyone who is looking to learn something new to an expert who has that skill and knowledge to share. All classes, workshops happen in real life at a place in your local city and area where teachers interact with students in person and share their knowledge, ideas and skills. The SkillPedia is a brainchild of a passionate team and our mantra is that everyone has knowledge to share and that learning never stops. Our passion is to make learning or education a better experience and more interesting.
Learn
Learning isn't something restricted to classrooms or schools. It is all around us and has no boundaries. At The SkillPedia, all our classes have been thoughtfully placed into six main categories namely - Creative Arts, Culinary Arts, Business, Education, Lifestyle and Technology. So if its dance or music, finance or entrance exams, cooking or software - all skills can be learnt here.
Teach
Are you a good cook or a math genius? A guitar expert or a fashion guru? Be it anything that you are good at, this is the right platform to come share that skill of yours and make a buck while you are at it. You don't need a certificate to teach at The SkillPedia but you do need to build your credibility. Here, others who learn from you will rate you based on how well you teach.
